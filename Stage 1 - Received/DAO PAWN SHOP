## Proposal Summary

I propose that the DAO spend less than 1500 in the commision of a DAO PAWN SHOP and AUCTION HOUSE


## Proposal Details


The Pawn Shop will hold NFTs for a loan. If a person needs liquidity right now for whatever reason (convert to fiat, to sweep CNFT floors, mothers operation)
they can trade in their NFT at a 10% discount from floor of said nft. If their NFT is worth 1000 they would get 900. This is to protect from market volatility. 
There will also be a percentage applied to the loan. This is how the DAO will earn passive income. If the NFT is not reclaimed under terms of the loan,
then the DAO would auction off or keep. Remember, bought at a 10% discount. This type of service is needed in this space, where you can use your asset as 
collateral for a loan. It does really stink to have to sell your NFT, this way there is a good chance that you don't have to. I know I have been in a 
nonemergency situation where I would have used this service. Like when C.B. held my ada hostage for 2 weeks. I could have let the PAWN SHOP hold one of my 
NFTs and then I could have had the ada to mint or sweep.  

Yes, a lot of real details would have to ironed out down the road if this proposal was to be accepted. Like how much ada to have in PAWN BANK for loans or how
to determine if and/or when an asset gets auctioned or left in treasury. This is step 1, just the digital build out. With being early in space we need to
capatalize on that timing by building these assets now rather than in 2 yrs. Who knows how much artist will charge then? I have been in contact with the fine
artist at BOSS CAT CUSTOM CLUB and they would be able to build out. 

The potential profit of the PAWN SHOP is proportionate to the use and value of NFTs. The passive income that comes from loan %s will go to the treasury. 

As you guys can see, I don't just want to sweep a CNFT floor, with this being my second DAO branded business proposal. I see real value in branding the DAO,
and being early in the game. Imagine a DAO business park!!! The ideal voting time would be within q2 or q3 of 2022.
Thank you for taking the time to consider this proposal.
